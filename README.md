# commit-lsp

Language Server for git commit messages.


You got editor smarts for programming, editing config files and even writing prose.
Why stop at writing commit messages?

Commit-lsp brings linting and auto completion
for commit messages based on the conventional commit format.

## Planned feature set

The following features are implemented (‚úÖ), in work (üöß) or
planned but not yet implemented (‚ùå):

- ‚ùå Style checking if the commit follows the conventional commit format
- ‚ùå Autocompletion for commit types and scopes with project specific config
    - Never guess again if your team uses `doc` or `docs` for documentation commits
- üöß Autocompletion for work item references
    - commit-lsp queries for Issues/Tickets/Work Items assigned to your local git user
      and provides completion for those assigned to you
    - Support for:
        - ‚ùå github
        - üöß AzureDevOps
        - ‚ùå gitlab

## Editor integration

Since commit-lsp uses the Language Server Protocol,
it should be compatible with every editor supporting it.

Commit-lsp is tested with neovim.
To integrate commit-lsp, copy the executable somewhere into PATH (or run `cargo install`) and add
the following into your `init.lua`:

```lua
if vim.fn.executable("commit-lsp") == 1 then
	vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(
		"FileType",
		{
			group=vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CommitLspStart", {}),
			pattern="gitcommit",
			callback=function()
				local client = vim.lsp.start_client {
					cmd = { "commit-lsp", "run" },
				}
				vim.lsp.buf_attach_client(0, client)
			end
		}
	)
end

```

## Connecting to Azure DevOps

The issue tracker integration is still very bare bones and work in progress.

Currently only AzureDevOps is supported.
To enable this integration, set the following environment variables:

- **COMMIT_LSP_AZURE_ORG** Name of the Azure organization
- **COMMIT_LSP_AZURE_PROJECT** Project inside of the organization
- **COMMIT_LSP_CREDENTIAL_COMMAND** Shell command used to acquire a Personal Access Token.

If all variables are set, then commit-lsp will run the command defined in `COMMIT_LSP_CREDENTIAL_COMMAND`
This command should print a Personal Access Token (PAT) to stdout.
The PAT must have Work Item `Read` access.

There is no quoting, currently only a simple split at white space is performed.
An example command could look like this:

    export COMMIT_LSP_CREDENTIAL_COMMAND="pass show development/azure"
